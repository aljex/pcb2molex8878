  The data sheet for the socket has an error for the width of the interior cavity.
  It correctly says 0.665 for the width in inches, but incorrectly says 19.90 for the same dimension in mm.
  0.665 inches = 16.891 mm
  The corrected pdf changes the text "(19.90)" to "(16.89)"

  The data sheet for the carrier has a drawing error where DIM.D and DIM.F both line up with the same feature,
  the outside edge of the left end, and no dimension lines up with the recessed edge on the left side.
  The numbers in the chart show that DIM.D is the outside edge, and DIM.F is the recessed edge.
  The corrected pdf moves the left drawing line for DIM.F slightly to the right to line up with the recessed edge on the left side.
