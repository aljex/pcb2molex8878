Molex 78805 has 28 pins, but there are other versions with more or less pins.
There is a 24-pin version of the carrier and cb included. They were made manually and the Makefiles don't know about them.

Molex_PCB_DIP24_Carrier.stl is the 24-pin carrier.
Molex_PCB_DIP24.kicad_pcb is the 24-pn pcb.

The carrier can be generated from the existing .scad file by overriding 2 variables from the commandline like this:
  openscad -D'main_x=34.52' -D'c_number=24' -o Molex_PCB_DIP24_Carrier.stl Molex78805_PCB_Carrier.scad

main_x=34.52 is the main_x of the 28-pin version (39.6mm) minus 2x2.54mm
c_number=24 is the number of contacts

The pcb and the .step file for the 3d view were made manually.
